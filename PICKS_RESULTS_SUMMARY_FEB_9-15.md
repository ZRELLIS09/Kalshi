## 💰 **UNIT ALLOCATION STRATEGY** (Post-Feb 14 Lessons)

### **Spread Tiers:**

#### **BIG SPREADS (15+) - REDUCED RISK**
- **ANY confidence:** 0.5u MAX
- **Alternative:** Use moneyline instead
- **NEVER in parlays/teasers**
- **Rationale:** Model identifies winners but struggles with blowout margins

#### **MID SPREADS (10-14) - SWEET SPOT** ⭐
- **75-80% conf:** 1.5u
- **80-85% conf:** 2.0u  
- **85%+ conf:** 2.0u (capped)
- **Rationale:** Model's strongest performance tier (100% on Feb 14!)

#### **SMALL SPREADS (<10) - STANDARD**
- **65-75% conf:** 0.5u
- **75-85% conf:** 1.0u
- **85%+ conf:** 1.5u

### **Multi-Bet Rules:**
- ✅ Mid spreads (10-14), small spreads (<10), MLs allowed
- ❌ NEVER spreads 15+ in multis
- ❌ NEVER 2u on multis (max 1u)

---

## 📈 **KEY RESULTS DISCOVERED**

### **Feb 14 - Houston vs Kansas State**
**Pick:** Houston -22.5 (0.5u)  
**Result:** Houston won 78-64 (14-point margin)  
**Outcome:** ❌ LOSS (needed 23+ to cover)  
**Learning:** Big spread, big favorite won easily but didn't cover massive number

### **Feb 14 Spread Tier Analysis** (From Memory):
**BIG SPREADS (15+):** 1-4 (20%) ❌  
**MID SPREADS (10-14):** 4-0 (100%) ✅✅✅  
**SMALL SPREADS (<10):** 3-2 (60%)  

**Key Insight:** Model excels at identifying winners but can't predict 20-point blowouts reliably.

## 📝 **NOTES**

- Model calibration appears solid after Codex audit (HCA 1.75, PROB_HCA 3.5, PROB_TEMPERATURE 5.0)
- Spread tier strategy implemented based on Feb 14 learnings
- Mid-spread picks (10-14) are the model's sweet spot
